# comp_curve

Consider the non-linear equation exp(-x) - c - x = 0.


Here "c" is a parameter in the equation. The root of the equation varies with "c" and thus the root is a function of "c". The code "calc_data.m" calculates the root for "c" in [0,10] and stores the data in data1.mat. 


This code loads in data1.mat and plots the root as a function of "c".
