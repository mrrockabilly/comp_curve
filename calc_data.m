% Consider the non-linear equation exp(-x) - c - x = 0.
% Here "c" is a parameter in the equation. The root of the equation varies
% with "c" and thus the root is a function of "c". 
% This code calculates the root for "c" in [0,10] and stores the data 
% in data1.mat. Later on the data is used in "plot_curve.m" to plot 
% the root as a function of "c".
